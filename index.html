    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p>
      SBN's core missions is to build a community that can support a culture of sustainability and local food. 
      There are many organizations that care about local food, but it can be difficult for them to know that they 
      have many other similar-minded organizations nearby.
    </p>

    <p>
      SBN has a member directory containing information about all buyers,
      vendors, and other organizations.  They wanted to build a 
      visualization that will go into marketing materials and 
      on their website to communicate the scope of their work 
      and to connect members of the local food community.
    </p>
    
    <p>SBN's existing database was not a pretty sight, and they did not 
      find it visually appealing enough to display on their website. 
      They wanted a visualization that would target business who were 
      interested in joining the network and seeing who else is involved.
       What they were specifically looking for was a list + visualization 
       to represent all the existing businesses in the network.
    </p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    

    <p>One of SBN's core missions is to build a community that can support a culture of sustainability and shopping local. 
      To do this, SBN has a member directory containing information about all buyers, vendors, and other organizations, 
      but they do not have an easy way to look all of their members, especially in regards to their specialty and location.</p>

    <p>To accomodate towards SBNs expectation, for our project, we decided to create a visualization that allows viewers to 
      where members are located and what the products/services offered are.  </p>
      <p>For design justifications please take a look at our Design Process section.</p>
      <h3>Final visualization screenshot:</h3>
      <p>
        For our final visualization we have a table and a map. The full table is not shown here due to limited space.
      </p>

      <h3>UI Walkthrough:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Our map allows for interactability! Simply highlight the cities on the map by clicking and dragging. Move the box around to select different cities at a time. </p>
          <img src= "images/selection.gif"></li>
          <li><p>Zoom in and out to see the city plots more clearly. This can be done by scrolling on the map.</p>
            <img src="images/zoom.gif">
        </li>
      </ul>
    
    

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

      <h3> Summary of Data Provided:</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset we were provided initially was not easy to work with. There were a few issues:
          <li>
            Data was not presented in a compact manner. Too much clutter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some columns were unecessary for our visualization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data was very messy. For example, Product/Services offered were not grouped into categories, making the data not clean and uniform.
          </li>
        </p>

        <p> Once we sat down to clean all the data, we were much happier with the results and finalized the specifics of our visualization.</p>
     

    <h3> Data Types</h3>
    <p> 
      For the dataset we were mainly dealing wih Strings. This was completely based on the data we were provided.
    </p>
      

    <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>
      The dataset we were given had the information for a little over 100 members. 
      To make the data usable, we had to clean it up and properly categorize each member organization. 
      This required us to research any gaps in the data (for example, organizations that did not have an 
      address/location in the dataset), as well as to categorize each member based on what they sell or 
      are focused on (catering, beverages, consulting, green energy, etc.)
    </p>

    <h3>Summary of task table.</h3>
    <p> Our original task table had a lot more points, but we feel like in our final visualizations
      we definitely hit these two tasks from our original plans.

      Although we couldn't show the trend of growing members over the years due to data limitation, the spread
      and density of dots across the map represent the growing number of members over the years
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal after making this task table was to represent the tasks in a nice, easy to read enough manner. 
      The problems we faced along the way were limitation on available data, coding in D3 experience and time management.
    </p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><b>Original Idea:</b></p>
    <p>
      Before we had access to any data, we wanted to make a visualizations of a map that showed the increasing number 
      of businesses each year as plots points on the map. Given below is an example of the visualization we wanted to base it off of.
    </p>
    <img src="images/mapOverTime.gif">

    <p>With time, we realized this would not work for the following reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>The dataset provided did not show the month/year the business joined SBN, to show the progress over time.</li>
        <li>We needed to establish brushing and linking as per project requirements</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>So, this was scratched, and we went back to the drawing board and came up with the following design.</p>


    <p> <b>Final "interactive" sketch made on Tableau: </b> </p>
    <img src = "images/ogSketch.png" height = "450" width ="650">

    <p>Our original idea for the map was to not only brush and link between a map and a table, but also allow for more interactability
      for the user by adding a filter to select by product or service as seen in the screenshot above. The different products/services would be 
      distinguished by color.

      However, we faced some issues along the way:
      <ul>
        <li>Boston had several different businesses with different products/services. The overlapping colors could be confusing to the eye.</li>
        <li>There were too many categories under products/services, which meant too many unecessary colors on the map.</li>
        <li>We didn't know how to code that in D3!</li>

        <li>Usability testing proved to be confusing for the teams that tested our visualization. Listed below is their specific feedback for the sketch at the time.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure that zoom feature is enabled to make sure there is no overlap.</li>
          <li>Get rid of outliers like Ohio and New Jersey, since they are not super relevant to your visualization.</li>
          <li>If you do keep the differentiation of products or services by color, make sure to use primary colors since many of the colors look similar and can be confusing.</li>
          <li>Possibly get rid of filter feature completely?</li>
        </ul>
        
      </ul>

      So, we decided to make the decision to simplify our plan and remove the filter + colors features entirely. 

      This resulted in our final visualization, that you can see in our visualization section!

    </p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>In conclusion, our visualization represents the existing businesses 
      registered with SBN through a map + table. 
      If we had more time, we would definitely implement linking. </p>
      <p>
      In the future, interesting features to add would be:
      <ul>
        <li>
          To add a tooltip. This way, the cities would be more clearly defined, allowing for clarity and transparency for the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement a filter. This would allow the user to filter out cities that are unecessary for their viewing.
        </li>
      </ul> 
    </p>
